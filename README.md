## Why?
I created this Cocoa Pods specs repo to save some 'deprecated' or pending of approval podspecs.


## How to use
You only need to add this repo to your Cocoa Pods list of repos to search.

```
pod repo add patoroco-specs git@github.com:patoroco/personal-specs.git
```

After that you can search as usual (i.e. `pod search admob`).

## Do you recommend a good presentation about Cocoa Pods?
Sure! I used [**[these slides]**](http://maroto.me/ttzc) in my talk on Codemotion talking about Cocoa Pods (in spanish).
